Traditional Shoyu Ramen (Soy Sauce Ramen)
Serves: 2–3
Prep time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 1 hour

Ingredients

Broth (Soup Base):
4 cups chicken stock (or pork broth for richer flavor)
2 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock)
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 tbsp sake
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 small piece of ginger (sliced)
2 cloves garlic (smashed)
1 green onion (cut in halves)

Tare (Seasoning Sauce):
3 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp mirin
½ tbsp sake
1 tsp sugar
(Mix together and set aside; this gives ramen its signature shoyu flavor.)

Toppings:
2–3 slices chashu pork (braised pork belly or shoulder)
2 soft-boiled eggs (ajitsuke tamago)
1 sheet nori (seaweed)
½ cup menma (seasoned bamboo shoots)
1 small handful bean sprouts
1 chopped green onion
Optional: corn, narutomaki (fish cake), spinach

Noodles:
2 servings fresh ramen noodles (thin and curly preferred)

Preparation Steps
1. Prepare the Broth
In a pot, heat sesame oil and sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant.
Add chicken stock, dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar.
Simmer gently for 30–45 minutes.
Strain out the solids and keep the broth warm.

2. Cook the Noodles
Boil ramen noodles according to the package (usually 2–3 minutes).
Drain quickly to keep them springy. Do not overcook.

3. Assemble the Ramen Bowl
Add 1–2 tbsp of tare (seasoning sauce) to the bottom of each bowl.
Pour in hot broth and mix gently.
Add the cooked noodles.
Top with chashu pork, egg halves, green onions, menma, nori, and other toppings.


Tips
For authentic flavor, use kombu and bonito flakes to make homemade dashi.
You can prepare chashu pork and ramen eggs a day ahead for deeper flavor.
Adjust soy sauce and mirin amounts to taste — shoyu ramen should be savory but slightly sweet.
