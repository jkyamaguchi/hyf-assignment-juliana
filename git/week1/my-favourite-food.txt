Sukiyaki (Japanese Beef Hot Pot)
Serves: 2–4
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 20 minutes

Ingredients
For the Sukiyaki Sauce (Warishita):
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup mirin (sweet rice wine)
¼ cup sake
2 tbsp sugar
¼ cup water (optional, to adjust taste)

For the Hot Pot:
300–400g (10–14 oz) thinly sliced beef ribeye or sirloin
½ block tofu (firm or silken), cut into cubes
1 small bunch of shungiku (chrysanthemum greens) or spinach
1 medium onion, sliced
1 small Chinese cabbage (napa cabbage), chopped
1 bunch green onions or leeks, cut diagonally
1 pack shiitake or enoki mushrooms, trimmed
1 small konnyaku noodles (shirataki), rinsed and drained
1 raw egg per person (optional, for dipping)

Preparation Steps

Make the Sauce (Warishita):
In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar.
Bring to a gentle simmer until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

Prepare Ingredients:
Arrange beef, tofu, vegetables, and noodles neatly on a large platter — this makes cooking at the table easier and more fun.

Cook Sukiyaki:
Heat a cast-iron or shallow pan on medium heat.
Lightly oil the surface and sear a few slices of beef.
Pour in a bit of the warishita sauce to flavor the beef.
Add tofu, vegetables, and noodles around the pan.
Pour in more sauce as needed and let everything simmer together.
Cook until the vegetables are tender and flavors blend.

Serve:
Traditionally, each person takes cooked ingredients and dips them into a small bowl of raw beaten egg (optional) before eating.

Tips
If you prefer it less salty, add a little water or dashi to dilute the sauce.
For a vegetarian version, use mushrooms or firm tofu instead of beef and substitute soy sauce + dashi for the umami.
