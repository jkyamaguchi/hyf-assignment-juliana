## Reflection
### 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
1) Create a filter that highlights the buttons when hovered.
2) Put Javascript in a separated file and link it to the html file.
3) Visualize the mobile version in developer mode on browser.

### Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilotâ€™s suggestions to suit your needs?
1) When I wanted a more lighter effect when hover the buttons.
2) I have to tweak manually the padding values in the header to align the text the way I wanted.

### How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
Accepting modifications in the code proposed by Copilot is handy, but it can be a big trouble in the future regarding the maintenance of the code when you don't understand what is happening in a specific function or why some values properties should be set as AI suggested. On the other hand, using Copilot as a learning partner is time saving, because you already have the context in the environment and you just have to "chat" about the issues or ask to explain about some concepts. In that way, you can understand better how build the code and solve problems without be an errand in StackOverFlow or vague in to much information in  documentations. 

### Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
1) I could not learning for real.
2) I could end up in a complex code instead of a simpler, but good solution.
3) I could not fix the code in the future because it was all AI generated and I could not analyze and solve a problem independently.
